# Scenario details
This example demonstrates a sales and marketing company that creates incentive programs. These programs reward customers, suppliers, salespeople, and employees. Data is fundamental to these programs, and the company wants to improve the insights gained through data analytics using Azure.

The company needs a modern approach to analysis data, so that decisions are made using the right data at the right time. The company's goals include:
* Combining different kinds of data sources into a cloud-scale platform.
* Transforming source data into a common taxonomy and structure, to make the data consistent and easily compared.
* Loading data using a highly parallelized approach that can support thousands of incentive programs, without the high costs of deploying and maintaining on-premises infrastructure.
* Greatly reducing the time needed to gather and transform data, so you can focus on analyzing the data.

## Potential use cases
This approach can also be used to:

* Establish a data warehouse to be a single source of truth for your data.
* Integrate relational data sources with other unstructured datasets.
* Use semantic modeling and powerful visualization tools for simpler data analysis.
